            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook penne uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until browned but not crispy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in same skillet over medium-high heat; stir in mushrooms. Cook and stir until mushrooms softened and released their liquid.</li>
            <li>Add garlic; cook 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in cream and Italian seasoning.</li>
            <li>Off heat, add penne to sauce; toss to coat. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese; serve.</li>
